Rules:
		Welcome to Portal-Combat! You are a purple dot that must 
	traverse multiple levels while avoiding enemies and using your 
	handy dandy portal gun. 
		Although your character on his own can't move through walls, 
	you can use your portal gun to place portals to get to the other 
	side of a wall. Simply click the portal button and you will be 
	promoted with a message telling you to place the first portal via a 
	click and then a second one, however the second click must be close
	to the original one. Once set, you can use the portal to transport. 
		You aren't the only one of the map though, red enemies are placed
	around the map that randomly patrol. However, once they get within a 
	certain distance of you, they will hunt you down and if they get too 
	close you will have to retry the level. Best defense against the reds
	is the laser, it shoots in four directions (up, down, left, right), but 
	will destroy enemies that get to close. Fire it by clicking the laser
	button next to the portal button.
		If you get stuck you can simply hit the retry button. Good luck and be 
	careful, you only have a limited amount of lasers and portals per level. Let
	the combat, of the portal variety, begin! 
	
Bugs:
	Enemies can jump through walls if they approach the wall at a corner.

Large-Scale Information:
	-Both information for the laser and portal are stored within the level class. 
	-Both the Player and Enemy classes derive from the Object class.
	

Classes & Purpose:
	Constants:
		This class stores constants that are used across the program for various
	different purposes, such as GUI, Portal & Laser traits, as well player and 
	enemy constants such as speed.
	
	Enemy:
		Enemy is a dirivitive class of Object and controls the enemy units (red guys)
	on the screen. It is in charge of their movement, drawing, and what occurs if the 
	player sucssefully shoots them with a laser.
	
	Game:
		Game stores game data, such as the level layout, and also calls level to actually
	start the game. Its purpose is to store level layout and call level to start game. 
	
	Level:
		Like a reverse-mullet, the player gets party in the front, but in the back it's 
	all business, this is the business end of portal combat. This draws everything that
	is shown on the window at a given time, and is also in charge of getting mouse feedback
	as well as operations relating to the portal and laser. 
	
	Object:
		Object is the base case for both player and enemy, and controls collision detection
	as well setters and getters for objects. 
	
	Player:
		Player is a dirivitive class of Object and controls the players character (purple dot)
	on the screen. It controls movement, collision detection, as well as the teleportation that
	occurs after use of a portal. 
	
	Rectangle:
		Rectangle is used to create the blocks that the player is bound by on the screen. It 
	creates rectangles that can then be checked for collision detection.
	
Auxiliary Files: 
	cccfiles: Taken from "C++ For Everyone" by Cay S. Horstmann
		The files within cccfiles were used to print the window as well as many of the drawing
	functions such as Points and Lines. The files were not changed by us for the project.
